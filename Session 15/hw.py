# Write a definition for a class named Circle with attributes center and radius, where center is a Point object and radius is a number.
# Instantiate a Circle object that represents a circle with its center at 
# (150, 100) and radius 75.
# Write a function named point_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Point and returns 
# True if the Point lies in or on the boundary of the circle.
# Write a function named rect_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns 
# True if the Rectangle lies entirely in or on the boundary of the circle.
# Write a function named rect_circle_overlap that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns 
# True if any of the corners of the Rectangle fall inside the circle. Or as a more challenging version, 
# return True if any part of the Rectangle falls inside the circle.
